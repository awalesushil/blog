Hi! I am Sushil, an undergrad Computer Science student at DWIT College, Nepal. I am interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Microservices. 

I currently teach Python programming to sophomore students at my college. I previously worked as a Web Developer Intern at Digital Media Lab, DWIT College.

I love learning new things, especially in, but not limited to, Computer Science and Mathematics. I let my curiosity drive my learning, and this blog is an outlet of that drive, where I aim to decipher a topic of interest to its simplest form and answer the critical questions of why and how things work.

The blog is also a log to keep track of things that I learn and validate my understanding of that topic.

Hope you enjoy reading this blog as much as I enjoy writing it.
